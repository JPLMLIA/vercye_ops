# üìò Vercye Architecture Documentation

## üîç Overview

The **Vercye system** orchestrates a modular, region-based crop yield simulation pipeline using **Snakemake** for dependency resolution and scalability. Each processing step is encapsulated in a standalone script, executed conditionally and in the correct order.

---

## üìÇ Scripts

Each script is self-documented via CLI help using the `--help` flag. For additional specifics, you can run the script directly in the terminal.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pipeline Execution with Snakemake

Snakemake defines workflows as rules. Each rule specifies expected inputs and outputs, enabling:

- **Automatic dependency resolution** ‚Äì Only missing or outdated outputs are recomputed.
- **Resumability** ‚Äì Failed executions can resume from the point of failure.
- **Parallelization** ‚Äì Regions and timepoints are processed independently, increasing efficiency.

---

## üßæ Config File

Every pipeline run uses a configuration file (YAML), which defines key parameters like:

- Data sources (e.g., LAI, meteorology)
- Resolution and CRS specs
- Simulation ranges (years, timepoints)
- Runtime limits and job parallelization caps
- Regions

This design ensures reproducibility and clean separation of configuration from logic.

## üîÑ Pipeline Logic

The following lists a high level overview of some of the most important features of the snakemake based pipeline steps (non-exhaustive).

### 1. Cropmask Reprojection
- **Rule**: `reproject_cropmask`
- Aligns the cropmask to match CRS and resolution of LAI data.
- **Requirement**: All LAI files in a year must have the same resolution and CRS.

---

### 2. Region Masking
- **Rule**: `constrain_cropmask`
- Crops the reprojected cropmask to each region for spatial filtering.

---

### 3. Region Validation
- **Rule**: `validate_region_has_cropland`
- Skips regions with too few cropland pixels to avoid wasting compute.
- Followed by a **checkpoint**: `all_regions_validated`, ensuring only valid regions are processed further. This enforces snakemake to first execute all validation jobs before continuing with processing the valid regions only.

---

### 4. Meteorological Data Acquisition

**Supported Sources**:
- **ERA5** (via Google Earth Engine): Max 10 concurrent jobs.
- **NASAPower**: Uses a global cache to avoid API rate limits.
    - First job: One-time cache fill per region for its full date range (single job per region to avoid race conditions in cache write).
    - Followed by region-timepoint-specific fetches.
- **CHIRPS**: Requires global files to be locally available.


---

### 5. LAI Analysis
- **Rule**: `lai_analysis`
- Computes daily LAI stats for the cropland pixels per region (e.g., mean LAI).
- Optimized with windowed reading for performance.

---

### 6. APSIM Simulation
- **Rule**: `run_apsim`
- Simulates many parameter combinations to model yield/LAI curves through APSIM.
- Supports both **Dockerized** and **local APSIM** installations depending on config parameter.

---

### 7. Simulation Matching
- **Rule**: `match_sim_real`
- Compares simulated outputs with observed LAI stats.
- Selects best-matching simulations based on curve similarity.

---

### 8. Yield Map Generation
- **Rule**: `generate_converted_lai_map`
- Uses conversion factors to transform predicted yield into pixel-level raster maps.

---

### 9. Yield Estimation & Aggregation
- **Rule**: `estimate_total_yield`
- Aggregates pixel-level predictions into total yield per region.
- Additional **aggregate rules** summarize results across all regions and timepoints.

---

### 10. Evaluation
- **Rule**: `evaluate_yield_estimates`
- Compares predictions to ground truth using metrics like:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R¬≤ (coefficient of determination)
  - Relative RMSE

---

### 11. Final Outputs

#### Per-Timepoint:
- PDF report (via `generate_final_report`)
- Aggregated CSVs and maps

#### Across Years:
- **Rule**: `generate_multiyear_comparison`
- Creates multi-year overviews and trend visualizations
