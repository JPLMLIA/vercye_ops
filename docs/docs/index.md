# VeRCYE Documentation

This documentation aims to provides a comprehensive guide to running the Versatile Crop Yield Estimate (VeRCYe) pipeline. The original VeRCYe algorithm is [published here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-024-00974-4).

Currently the documentation is a work in progress, so please visit again soon.


### Features
* Tools to greatly reduce manual effort required for executing the VERYCE crop yield estimate pipeline.
* All workflow steps are wrapped in a well-documented CLI interface to permit step by step execution.
* The core CLI steps are also wrapped in a Snakemake-based data processing pipeline to batch execute yield estimates in an easy to run and reproducible manner.
