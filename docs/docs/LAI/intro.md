The VeRCYE algorithms relies on identifying APSIM simulations that best match remotely sensed LAI data. We provide an additional pipeline to
create such LAI estimates from Sentinel-2 data. The LAI creation is not included in the standard VeRCYE pipeline, as it requires downloading\
and processing large amounts of data, which we want to decouple from the execution of the simulation. Once generated, LAI data for a region can always be reused with different VeRCYE configuration.

The documentation on how to use the LAI pipeline will follow soon.
